\maketitle

In Problem 1, I used a different version of repeated squaring which yielded the same answer. It looks like the one in the solutions would be faster.\\
\\
In 2, I used $egcd$ as normal $gcd$ and then went backwards. My answer was still the same however.\\
\\
In 4, I didn't prove the amount of operations it takes for 4c and 4d. I thought it would be obvious... But I still came up with the same answers.\\
