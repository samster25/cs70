\maketitle

In 6a, I ended up proving the same hypothesis but I used cross multiplication instead which led to the same result.\\
\\
In 7, I didn't state that if $r$ is irrational which leads to $m$ to be zero which does in fact exist, besides that I approached the proof the same way.\\
\\
For 9a, I didn't state that the use of $max(x-1,y-1)$ was incorrect but instead that another base case was needed to show that when $n=1$ the hypothesis falls apart.
