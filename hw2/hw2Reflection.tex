\maketitle

In 1c, I approached the problem by making $n=k+2$ by induction since there were two base cases. I then showed how the $F_n$ was equivalent to the recursive relationship by simplifying and then grouping by powers.\\
\\
In 4a, I proposed the solution to the problem to be $a=a_0 + ky, ~b=b_0+kx$ which I showed was infact a valid solution but I didn't do a proof to derive it.\\
\\
In 6b, I did a proof of cases instead of a contradiction. The cases I used were if $n$ was prime or nonprime. I also used the lemma from 6a to simplify my proof.\\
